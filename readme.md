# Moderator Bot
A Discord bot that uses Google's Perspective API to moderate chat.

## Getting Started
There are three ways to use the Moderator Bot:

### 1. Add the Bot to Your Server  
This is the simplest option - simply invite the bot to your Discord server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1071451913024974939&permissions=1377342450896&scope=bot). You will need to have administrator permissions on your server to use the bot.

### 2. Run with Docker
To run the bot using Docker, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -e DISCORD_TOKEN=<your_discord_token> -e PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY=<your_perspective_api_key> -d /path/to/your/data:/Moderator/data ghcr.io/paillat-dev/moderator:latest
```

### 3. Clone and Run on Your Machine  
To run the bot on your local machine, clone this repository at `/Paillat-Dev/Moderator` and create a `.env` file with the following two values:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=<your_discord_token>
PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY=<your_perspective_api_key>
```

Then run `main.py` to start the bot, but remember to install the required packages first with 
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt.
```

Note: If you're not comfortable with any of the above steps, we recommend using option 1.

## Commands and Usage

The Moderator Bot has the following command:

### /setthreshold 

This command allows you to set the threshold for each type of toxicity. The options for toxicity are:

- toxicity
- severe_toxicity
- identity_attack
- insult
- profanity
- threat
- sexually_explicit
- flirtation
- obscene
- spam

To use the `/setthreshold` command, you must have administrator permissions. If a value is not specified, the default threshold will be set to the best avlues I found. You can view the current settings for your server by using the `/setthreshold` command without any options. **You will need to run this command at least once when adding the bot to your server for the firs time**.

### /setup

Command used to setup/change misc parameters, like:
- `logs_channel` : The channel where you want the logs & updates being sent, usually a channel accessible only to moderators, please be shure of checking that moderator has acces to the channel.
- `enable` : TRUE / FALSE , self explanatory
- mod_role : the role of the moderators. Used to ping the moderators when the bot is unsure of the toxicity of a message

### /get_settings

Get the current settings.

### /help

Get some help & explanations.

### /get_toxicity

A debug / testing command. Used to get the values detected by the bot for a given message and see if it would have been deleted, usually used to tweak the settings with `/setthreshold`.
